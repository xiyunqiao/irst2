Hi, I am Yunqiao. I am now studying for phd in Harbin Institute of Technology, and I studied in Harbin Institute of Technology (Weihai) and Beijing Institute of Technology before. And I worked as an engineer in CETC and NAURA a few years ago, respectively.

I feel pleased to discuss with you in infrared imaging and image processing research and hoping that we can get progress together.
